Description
===========
The Indexer is separated in two parts: the indexing mechanism and the searching mechanism. 
The indexing mechanism is able to generate a text index. You put some text fields with a unique id into the indexer. 
the searching mechanism returns text clippings with the unique id to identify the origin. 
It is intended for searching text content in database fields or other text oriented stores.

The Indexer has two main tasks:
- building the index file
- searching for a keyword in the index file

How to use
==========
Include the file 'class.indexer.php'. Read the examples ('index.php' and 'search.php') to understand how it works.

The result of the searching process is an array of IndexerResult objects.
The IndexerResult objects properties are:
	id    : ID of the indexed text values
	keys  : array of the matching word for the search string
	score : ranking / relevance of the result
	text  : string snippet, with the keys in it


Installation
============
- copy the files in a directory
- be sure to allow write access to the two sub-dirs 'index' and 'object'
- maybe edit the blacklist.php to define the words, which you don't want to index
